On Raspberry do the following:
$> sudo apt update
$> Sudo apt upgrade
$> sudo apt autoremove
$> sudo apt clean
$> cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit
$> sudo shutdown –h now

Pop your SD card in your PC's card reader. Most likely the file manager will open a window or two. Close these windows if so.
Now find out where the card is mounted. Go to a terminal session and type:
$> df –h

You'll see something like:
/dev/mmcblk0p1                   56M   20M   37M  36% /media/user/boot
/dev/mmcblk0p2                  7.2G  3.8G  3.0G  56% /media/user/rootfs

The important thing is that you now know that your SD card is on /dev/mmcblk0 . It has two partitions, /dev/mmcblk0p1 and /dev/mmcblk0p2.
Make a note of where your card is mounted and use this wherever I use /dev/mmcblk0 , /dev/mmcblk0p1 or /dev/mmcblk0p2.

Let's unmount this but leave the card in the card reader. This will let us take an image.
$> sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /dev/mmcblk0p2

Install dcfldd if you haven't already got it (it won't hurt to try to install it again):
$> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dcfldd

Now take the image. Again, change /dev/mmcblk0 to wherever your SD card is mounted.
$> sudo dcfldd if=/dev/ mmcblk0 of=raspbian_stretch_kinetic_ocv346_rpizero.img

Once finished, you should force a synchronise of any outstanding input or output (there shouldn't be any, but just to be sure), then the card will be safe to remove.
$> sudo sync

Next, let's change the ownership of the .img file. The image file will be owned by root (because we used sudo). It's probably a wise move to change the ownership to your user. For example, my username is 'user' but you'll need to change this to your username:
$> sudo chown user.user raspbian_stretch_kinetic_ocv346_rpizero.img

And shrink image:
$> sudo ./image-shrink.sh raspbian_stretch_kinetic_ocv346_rpizero.img

$> tar -czvf raspbian_stretch_kinetic_ocv346_rpizero.img.tar.gz raspbian_stretch_kinetic_ocv346_rpizero.img
